            As mentioned in the previous html, the way the code is read, there will be an error in line 24.
            That is because the button has not been introduced yet (line 10), so we can't add a listener to something that didn't exist yet.*/

    <h2>JavaScript String Methods</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>.length     - it counts how many characters there are in the attached string</li>
        <li>.charAt(n)  - where n is a number, it takes the character in that position. Counting starts at 0</li>
        <li>.charCodeAt(n)   - where n is a number, it shows the UTF-16 code of the character at that position </li>
        <li>.at(n)      - similar to .charAt, but can handle negative indexes. If negative, it counts right to left instead of left to right.</li>
    </ul>
    Note:<br>if n is larger than the length of the string, it will be undefined
    <h2>Extracting Parts of a String</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>slice(start, end)
            <ul><li>starts at the first index, ends before the next index. Also accepts negative indexes.</li></ul></li>
        <li>substring(start, end)
            <ul><li>similar to slice, but negative indexes are considered as 0.</li></ul></li>
        <li>substr(start, length)
            <ul><li>starts at the index and ends at the specified length.</li>
            <li>if length is not included, it will show the rest of the string</li>
            <li>only accepts one negative index</li></ul></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>String to Uppercase and Lowercase</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>.toUpperCase() - when attached to a string, it turns all of the characters to uppercase</li>
        <li>.toLowerCase() - when attached to a string, it turns all of the characters to lowercase</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Trim</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>.trim() - removes white spaces at the start and end of a string </li>
        <li>.trimStart() - removes white spaces at the start of a string</li>
        <li>.trimEnd() - removes white spaces at the end of a string</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Padding</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>.padStart(length, padding) - pads a string at the start with the padding until the length is reached</li>
        <li>.padEnd(length, padding) - pads a string at the end with the padding until the length is reached</li>
        <li>.trimEnd() - removes white spaces at the end of a string</li>
    </ul>
    Note: <br>To pad a number, turn them into a string first.
    <h2>Repeat</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>.repeat(n) - repeats the string for n amount of times</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Replace</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>.replace(OldWord, NewWord) - finds the old word with the new word. Only works for the first word found.</li>
        <li>.replaceAll(OldWord,NewWord) - replaces all the OldWord with the NewWord.</li>
    </ul>
    Notes: <br>This is case sensitive. <br> To find it regardless turn it into this /OldWord/i (insensitive)<br> To change all matches turn it into this /OldWord/g (global match).<br>To do both, turn it into this /OldWord/ig
    <h2>String to Array</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>.split(",") - splits the string between the listed character ",". Only using "" will result in every letter being split</li>
    </ul>
